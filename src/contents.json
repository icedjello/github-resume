    "other": "Outside of work, I am passionate about my hobbies and often engage in multiple projects simultaneously. In spring and summer, I relish fishing on lakesides. As colder seasons set in, I indulge in playing board games; recently, I've been running a Dungeons & Dragons campaign with colleagues at Smart. Additionally, you can find me rock-climbing whenever I get the chance, and occasionally, I've been known to strum the guitar."
