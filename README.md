# My CV

If you're here, I've either asked you for a job or you really need a CV. In either case fear not! Have a look around, take what you need and let try to explain what's going on.

## Tools used:

### React

This one's fairly obvious; if you're not sure I can't really help you, so maybe just type "React" into whatever search-engine you like and work your way down.
Basically, it's a JavaScript framework, I'm not particularly enamoured with it but it's popular, has loads of support and works well with the rest.

### TypeScript

Sort of the same as React. Is it actually required here? No, not really. But TypeScript is popular and can sometimes help large groups of programmers work better together. JavaScript is dynamically-typed and TypeScript makes it act more like a statically-typed language. Practically speaking, it tells you when you're trying to jam a array-shaped-peg into a number-shaped-hole.

### Vite

Vite is a build tool. If you've used Create React App in the past, it's like that but faster/better. It pulls together all the framework and bundler stuff together and throws in a development server so you can see what you code. It's nice to use, has a simple and effective CLI and good documentation.

### Tailwind CSS

I'm not the greatest CSS guy. It's big, complicated and for some reason has always scared. When I told a colleague this, he said "try tailwind". So I did. And it's cool; it's a CSS framework: Remember being told to center something? Remember the cold sweats? Flexbox? CSS-Tricks? Tailwind makes that a little less traumatic.
But then I realized I'm not Jony Ive and designers do more than just Figma and keynotes. I told this to another colleague and they suggested:

### Shadcn/ui

If at any point you thought this CV looked good, that's because I used Shadcn/ui. It's a bunch of components you can copy and paste from the internet (it also has a nifty little CLI). It looks great, professional and modern. It's super simple to adjust, and for some reason it's completely free!
